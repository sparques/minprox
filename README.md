# minprox

A minimal HTTP proxy supporting CONNECT method.

Supporting CONNECT means this proxy can handle forwarding HTTPS connections.

Based on [this gist](https://gist.github.com/yowu/f7dc34bd4736a65ff28d).

Has no external dependencies (uses stdlib only).

# Purpose

 - Something small and easy to throw places for temporarily routing things around.
 - Something small and simple enough to easy tack on additional functionality
